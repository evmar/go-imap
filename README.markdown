Here's a little IMAP client in Go.

* `src/imap` contains the "imap" package that implements the IMAP protocol client
* `src/imapsync` contains a "main" package that uses the "imap" library to list or download gmail labels (= inboxes)

This hasn't been tested against anything but gmail's IMAP yet, and will likely eat your mail, etc.

To build, set your GOPATH to the base directory and run `go install imapsync`, also from the base directory. This will compile the "imap" library (which will go in "/pkg") and compile and link the "imapsync" test app (which will go in "bin"). 

To test the app, create a file called "auth" that contains your GMail username and password (on one line each), and run one of:

* `bin/imapsync list`
* `bin/imapsync fetch MAILBOXNAME`
